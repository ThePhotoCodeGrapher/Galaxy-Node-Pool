# .gal.group (Galaxy Node Pool Root Group)

## Purpose
Defines the top-level group for all Galaxy Node Pool documentation, configuration, and protocol files. Provides unified navigation and structure for the entire Galaxy ecosystem following the Gelato Protocol standard.

## Members
- pool/.gal.group.pool             # All pool-related .gal files
- POOL-ARCHITECTURE.gal            # Overall architecture of the Galaxy Node Pool
- POOL-CONFIG.gal                  # Configuration options for the pool
- NODE-CONFIG.gal                  # Configuration options for nodes
- POOL-ROADMAP.gal                 # Development roadmap and milestones
- MAIN-POOL-OVERVIEW.gal           # Main pool architecture and eligibility requirements
- node/.gal.group.node             # All node-related .gal files
- versioning/.gal.group.versioning # All versioning-related .gal files
- phases/.gal.group.phases         # All phase-related .gal files
- beta/.gal.group.beta             # All beta and launch-related .gal files
- enterprise/.gal.group.enterprise # All enterprise and main net integration .gal files

## Usage
- Reference this file as the entry point for the GAL Protocol documentation and config.
- Each subgroup contains domain-specific .gal files organized by purpose.
- This structure follows the Gelato Protocol's modular, discoverable documentation pattern.
- Extend with more groups (e.g., client, orchestration, protocol-wide) as needed.
