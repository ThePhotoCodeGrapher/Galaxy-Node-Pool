# Galaxy Node Pool Architecture (.gal)

## Overview
The Galaxy Node Pool is a modular, Dockerized Go service that acts as a registry and discovery layer for Galaxy Network Nodes. It supports both public and private pools, node specialization, and secure, scalable deployment.

## Main Net Federation & Incentives
- Every Galaxy Node Pool (public or private) must connect to the main net registry for discoverability and protocol compliance.
- Private pools pay registration/connection fees (in GAL or protocol tokens) to the main net.
- Usage or transaction fees from private pool activity are routed through the main net, with a portion distributed to stakers and locked-in participants.
- Main net provides advanced services (auditing, cross-pool discovery, insurance, etc.) for additional fees.
- This ensures all pools contribute to the security, growth, and value of the main net ecosystem.
- Stakers and locked-in participants benefit directly from increased pool activity and protocol adoption.

## Components
- **Pool Registry**: gRPC server for node registration, heartbeats, and discovery
- **Node**: Service that registers with the pool and advertises specialization
- **Clients**: Query the pool for available nodes (by specialization, org, etc.)

## Security
- TLS for all communication
- Authentication for private/org pools
- Role-based access control

## Deployment
- Docker-native, config-driven
- Supports main/test/dev and org pools
- DNS wildcards for scalable node addition

## Extensibility
- New pool/node types can be added without breaking compatibility
- Designed for integration with Gelato Protocol and other modular systems
