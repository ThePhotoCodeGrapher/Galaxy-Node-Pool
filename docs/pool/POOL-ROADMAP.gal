# Galaxy Node Pool Roadmap (.gal)

## Purpose
Outlines the roadmap for the Galaxy Node Pool project, including phases and key milestones.

> Note: Every pool (public or private) that connects to the main net contributes value and fees to the protocol, supporting staker rewards and protocol growth.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Q2 2025)
- Implement public pool registry with gRPC API
- Node registration, heartbeat, and discovery
- Dockerization and config-driven deployment
- TLS security for all endpoints
- Modular plugin architecture
- Service container for dependency injection
- Event system for inter-component communication

### Critical Checkpoints
- Security audit of authentication system
- Performance testing under high node counts (1000+ nodes)
- Documentation completeness check

## Phase 2: Private/Org Pools (Q3 2025)
- Add authentication and access control
- Support for org-specific pools
- Role-based access and job privacy
- Custom plugin support for organizations
- Metrics and monitoring integration
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Multi-region deployment support

### Critical Checkpoints
- Data isolation verification
- Access control penetration testing
- Compliance documentation for enterprise use

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q4 2025)
- Federation between pools
- Marketplace and analytics integration
- Advanced scheduling and load balancing
- REST/gRPC-Gateway for web clients
- AI-driven node optimization
- Cross-pool task routing
- Reputation system for nodes
- Advanced billing and payment options

### Critical Checkpoints
- Federation protocol security audit
- Cross-pool performance benchmarking
- Scalability testing with federated pools

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (Q1-Q2 2026)
- Third-party plugin marketplace
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Machine learning for predictive scaling
- Integration with other blockchain networks
- Developer SDK for custom integrations
- Mobile management applications
- Enterprise SLA guarantees

### Critical Checkpoints
- Plugin security verification system
- Blockchain integration security audit
- Enterprise SLA verification testing

## Future Directions
- Decentralized governance for network parameters
- AI-powered node selection and optimization
- Cross-chain identity and payment systems
- Integration with emerging compute paradigms
- Quantum-resistant security measures
