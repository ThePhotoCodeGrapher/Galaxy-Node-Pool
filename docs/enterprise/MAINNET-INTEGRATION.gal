# MAINNET-INTEGRATION.gal

## Purpose
Defines the integration between Galaxy Node Pools and the Galaxy Main Net, following the Gelato Protocol standard.

## Main Net Integration Architecture

### Overview
Every Galaxy Node Pool (public or private) connects to the Galaxy Main Net, contributing to the network's value and enabling global node discovery and federation.

### Components
- **Registry Connection**: Pools register with the main net registry
- **Federation Protocol**: Cross-pool discovery and communication
- **Blockchain Integration**: Identity, payments, and rewards via Stellar
- **Staker Rewards**: Distribution of fees to network stakers

### Registration Flow
1. Pool generates a Stellar keypair for identity
2. Pool sends registration fee to main net account
3. Pool submits metadata (domain, endpoint, capabilities)
4. Main net verifies payment and adds pool to registry
5. Pool receives confirmation and begins periodic heartbeats

### Fee Structure
- **Registration Fee**: One-time fee to join the main net (5 XLM)
- **Activity Fee**: Percentage of node registration fees (2%)
- **Transaction Fee**: Small fee per transaction (0.01 XLM)
- **Distribution**: 70% to stakers, 20% to protocol development, 10% to operations

## Value Proposition
- **For Private Pools**: Global discovery, federation, compliance verification
- **For Public Pools**: Additional traffic, reputation, incentives
- **For Stakers**: Rewards from all pool activity
- **For the Network**: Increased utility, security, and value

## Optional Services
- **Compliance Verification**: Verification of node compliance with protocol standards
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mediation for disputes between nodes and clients
- **Insurance**: Coverage for failed transactions or node downtime
- **Analytics**: Network-wide analytics and insights
- **Reputation System**: Cross-pool reputation tracking
